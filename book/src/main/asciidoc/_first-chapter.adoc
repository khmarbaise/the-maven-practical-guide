= The Start
What is the idea of the book? Which things you should consider and why you should read this book.

This book is intended to show how to use Apache Maven for practical purpose, and
it's not intended as a reference guide. Those references are available
on the Apache Maven pages. Of course often I will need to make some references
and explain the details to make the reader (you) understand why I'm telling you
to do things to do in a particular way.

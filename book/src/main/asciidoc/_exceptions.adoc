= Exceptions from Best Practices

This part will describe/discuss exceptions from the best practices
or in other words ignoring conventions over configuration.

== Layout
Sometimes people to say I don't want to follow
best practices. For example using a different
directory layout? You can do that if you really need that,
but it depends...

The first question I ask in such a situation is: Why do you like to
do that? What kind of problem are you trying to solve?




// The question is why do you need such thing?

== THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS
This guide is an attempt to write a practical guide about Apache Maven.
Its idea is to give practical hints how to use Apache Maven and describe
and show what are the best practices and why you should follow them.

If you have any suggestions, improvements or found issues please
report them via the <<preface.project-metadata, bug tracker>>, mentioned in metadata area.

This is also in its early stage so a large number of areas are
just a containing a couple of sentences or even less.
Those simply reminders to my own.

== Overview

This is a more or less full documentation about Apache Maven.

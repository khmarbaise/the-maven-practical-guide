= Best Practice

== Generate Into Source Folder

generating code into src folder instead of 'target'.
Pro/Cons on that approach..

In Maven the convention exists to put everything which is generated,
compiled etc. into the `target` folder of the appropriate module.
Unfortunately in the wild you will find builds which do not follow the
convention and for example generate things into `src folder which is
a bad practice (Hint why?).

So let use think about this a little bit more. The first thing
is if you change something in `src` folder means your version control
system will be alarmed about such a change which on the other hand means
you will be alarmed about a change which is not really a change, cause
generated code will usually generate the same code from the same source
but usually with some changed time stamp within the generated code.
The consequence on the above is you must exclude some areas from your
version control view to suppress such irritations.

The next thing is you need to change the configuration of your appropriate
plugins, cause more or less all plugins follow that conventions (ok there
exist some exceptions). This implies your configuration in your pom gets
larger and of course does not follow the conventions over configuration
paradigm.

Other 'solutions' which fall into the same category do something different.
They generate into a folder within 'target' things like 'target/generated-code'
but they usually missed that plugins usually add the generated code folder
to the project sources folders automatically already.
But in contradiction they explicitly add the generated folder via supplemental
plugins like 'build-helper-maven-plugin' to the sources folder.

== Dependencies / DependencyManagement

Scope only in real dependencies not in dependencyManagement

means always use scope:test in the real project and not in dependencyManagement


== Deps via Props

Using properties to control the dependencies with a so called company pom?

Result: Complete build is necessary instead of using released within a build.



== Company wide parent(s)

Manifest setup with master parent.
[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
  <archive>
    <addMavenDescriptor>true</addMavenDescriptor>
    <index>true</index>
    <manifest>

      <addDefaultSpecificationEntries>true</addDefaultSpecificationEntries>

What should be defined in such a parent?

Style Guide for POM files.
SortPom (default style for pom files)

Why you should never use version ranges?

No different dependencies via profiles! Why ? The consequences?

Naming modules based on their artifactId's.

Answer: create a mod-core, mod-war and that's it?

== Building for different Environments
You are often face with the problem having different environments like
dev, test, prod this is just a simple example how real life is.

== How to do good integration tests for maven plugins

One of the final tests should be to clean your local repository
and start your integration tests of your plugin from scratch

rm -fr $HOME/.m2/repository
mvn -Prun-its clean verify

This should work without any problem.

== Nexus

why the order of the repositories does really matter...

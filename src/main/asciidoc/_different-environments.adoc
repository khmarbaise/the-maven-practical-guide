= Different Environments

== Overview

In the wild a usual problem occurs having configurations for
different environments like development, test, q&a and production.
The differences between those environments are most likely
things like username, password for an database connection or may
be other things.

I have to admit that the example with the database connection is not the
best, cause this would imply having such critical information within
your application which you never should do in real life. This is chosen
only as an example for information which are definitively different from
environment to environment.

Let us make a more realistic example out of this to get more relationship
to the real world. So we create an examples which consists of several files
which are different from environment to environment.

=== The Solutions

=== The Obvious Solution

Many people using Maven would suggest to use profiles for such
purposes. So you have different profiles which define the filtered
values for the appropriate environments and you will build the
appropriate artifacts.

This will result in calling Maven with the following commands to
produce artifacts for the different environments.

-------------------
mvn -Pdevelopment clean package
mvn -Ptest clean package
mvn -Pqa clean package
mvn -Pproduction clean package
-------------------

But unfortunately this approach has one big drawback. How would you
call Maven if you need the artifacts for development, test, q&a and
production? So your answer might look like this?

-------------------
mvn -Pdevelopment,test,qa,production clean package
-------------------

The disadvantage of this approach is that you have to give all these
parameters every time you call Maven maybe in several permutations
depending for which environment you would like to build. What does in
practice happen?  You simple forget them. Have you remembered to change
the configuration of your CI solution? Have you informed all your
team mates? I bet you missed something.

So solution should work by simply calling Maven like this:
-------------------
mvn clean package
-------------------


So in conclusion this approach is not ideal.

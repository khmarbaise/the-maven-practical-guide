= Single Module Projects

An often used setup of a Maven project has a single `pom.xml` file which
contains the definition for dependencies and plugins etc. The project has
a single artifact as a result which is often a `jar` file, but of course
you can create `war`, `ear` or alike. That will be defined by the given
`<packaging>jar</packaging>` tag.

== Directory Structure
The following directory structure shows the default directory layout of
a Maven project. That a convention to go that way. I strongly recommend
to keep that structure (link:_exceptions.adoc[more details ??)].

 +--- pom.xml
   +--- src
         +--- main
               +--- java
               +--- resources
         +--- test

=== Different dependent projects

Having several projects? Identifying duplication for example
plugin configuration, pluginManagement etc.
TODO: Add chapter about parents...

// Having a project common, cli and web.
//
// If you change common you have to (`mvn install`) and
// then goto to the cli project and build it also
// need to go to the web parts and build it as well.
//
// All of those projects are in different git repositories etc.
// The handling will become cumbersome.
// multi module-build. Nextchapter!
// TODO: The following is old text from multi-module-build:
// Before we know about multi-module-builds you should have created three
// separated maven projects and had to define dependencies between those modules
// and work on them without any relationship.  Obviously you can imagine that the
// above modules have relationship to each other, cause the `module-client` module
// has a dependency to the `module-core` whereas the `module-server` has a
// dependency to `module-core` and so on.
//
// Wouldn't it be the best if all the above module live within a single location
// (git repository or SVN trunk for example) where you could simply checkout
// those modules and work with your IDE on the whole project, cause if you need to
// change something in your `module-core` it's very likely that you need to change
// the depending module `module-client` as well? Exactly for such purposes a
// multi-module-build exists in Maven.

= Plugins

== Overview
The plugins of Maven building the foundation of the Maven eco system,
cause if you download Maven itself it's a relative small archive
(less than 8 {link-mib}) and Maven itself is more or less only a IoC
container which supports the life-cycle and other small things. If you
like to compile for example your source code this is provided by the
{link-maven-compiler-plugin} with the appropriate functionality.

This chapter will give you an overview of the different areas of
plugins sources, the different ideas of the plugins and their typical
usage within a Java project build.

=== The Plugin Sources

In general there are two big sources of plugin. The first source is
the area under the umbrella of the {link-apache-software-foundation}.
I will call them the **Core Maven Plugins**. The reason for this is that
you will find plugins like {link-maven-compiler-plugin},
{link-maven-jar-plugin} etc. in that area which provide the most basic
functionality for your build.

The second source is the https://www.mojohaus.org/plugins.html[MojoHaus]
area which also provides a large number of maven plugins.

Processor Plugin)

== The Different Plugins

In this chapter we will take a look on more or less every plugin which
is a participant of a usual Java build or to be more accurate a
participant of the {link-build-life-cycle}.

The lifecycle contains already bindings for usual plugins so 
in the majority of the cases its enough to build usual projects.

=== Clean Everything

If you want to be sure your build will start from scratch you need to
wipe out everything which has been created by previous operations or
the build itself. So the {link-maven-clean-plugin} is your friend
which will delete the 'target' folder of your project or in every
module in case of a multi-module build. This can be simply achieved by
calling maven like this:

[listing]
mvn clean


Usualy you won't ever think about the {link-maven-clean-plugin}, cause
by default it's bound to the 'clean' {link-life-cycle-phase} and there
is no reason to change the configuration of the
{link-maven-clean-plugin} or something similar. In rare situations it
could happen that you need to change the configuration and add
supplemental folders or files which should be deleted during a 'mvn
clean' call.

HINT: Something about the clean life cylce of the maven super pom!!

In the clean life cycle the following phases exist: pre-clean, clean, post-clean.

=== Resources

Often it occurs that your java code needs some kind of configuration
files.  One of the most famous examples for this kind of
configurations is one of those numerous logging frameworks like log4j,
logback, log4j2 etc.  So the question is where to locate such
configuration files? The {link-default-folder-layout} gives you the
hint to put such things into 'src/main/resources' which is of
course intended for the production code (in other words which is
packaged later into the jar file). Furthermore it is often the case as
well as having different configuration files for your unit tests cause
you would like having a different logging level in your unit test so
you need a different set of files which should be located into
'src/test/resources'. This means in other words those files will not
be packaged into the resulting jar file.

TODO: Move the following to test phase

HINT about super pom !

So usually you can simply put your appropriate configuration files
into 'src/test/resources' or 'src/main/resources' and they will
automatically be copied into 'target/classes' or
'target/test-classes'.  But why are they copied ? The most important
point about this is that you can use such resources by the usual java
resources way like this:

code example (getClass().getResourcesAsStream("/log4j.properties");
This works for unit tests and for your production code! (good example?)

One important thing to mention is that the order on your class path 
is that the resources from your test resources coming first before
your production code which means you can give a different configurtation file
for every file which you already use in your production code and so you
can change the behaviour in your unit tests to change things for example
the logging level or something else.

=== Let The Source Be With You

You usually write Java source code (ok ok sometimes you write
difference sources like {link-groovy}, {link-scala}, {link-ceylon} or
whatever) and of course you would like to compile such code into
usable class files which can be used to run your application
or to run your unit tests.

This is the purpose of the {link-maven-compiler-plugin} which will
compile your source code into class files.

The source code is located in 'src/main/java' and will be compiled
into the 'target/classes' folder. Apart from that the Maven Compiler
Plugin is also responsible to compile your unit/integration test code
which is located in 'src/test/java' into 'target/test-classes'.

=== Let's See If The Code Is Working?

After we have compiled the whole code we should run the unit tests to
check our code. This is done before the code will be packaged into a
jar file, cause if one of your unit tests will fail your build will
fail and no packages are being built.

For this purpose the {link-maven-surefire-plugin} is responsible
to run those unit tests.


=== Let The Jar's Come To Me

After the production code has been compiled into the appropriate
'.class' files they will be packed into a jar file which is the base
unit to be distributed.  The jar will contain only the files from
'target/classes'.  So if you don't do something special your unit
tests will never be packed into jar files.

The {link-maven-jar-plugin} is bound to the 'package' build life cycle
phase to create a jar file. This jar file contains only the files from
the 'src/main/java' inclusive the resources from 'src/main/resources'
area (Let use call it the production code area).

There exsist situations where you like to package your test code into
a jar as well. This can be achieved by using the `test-jar` goal of the
{link-maven-jar-plugin}. 

See examples (testing with common code).

Creating test-jars
non transitive behaviour of test-jar artifact. Solution create a usual separate module.

=== Install The Archive

After the jar archive has been created the archive can be installed into the local 
repository to be consumed by other projects on the same machine. For such a purpose
the {link-maven-install-plugin} is responsible.

=== Distribute It To The World

To break the limits of your machine you can distribute an jar archive to 
a remote repository which can be used by other users.
For this the {link-maven-deploy-plugin}.

=== Let The Force Be With You

The larger a build becomes the more you need to control what happens
within your build otherwise the {link-broken-window-problem} occurs
and will likely result in later problems you should prevent.

How can you force rules within in your build?  Sometimes it is not
enough to suggest the best practice you need to force the best
practices within a build. The tool to do so is the
{link-maven-enforcer-plugin}.


One of the basic things is to force your build is built with the
correct Maven version, cause htere exist some things which don't work
with older Maven versions etc.  The way to prevent building with the
wrong Maven version was to use the `prerequsites` tag like this:

[source,xml,numbered]
--------------------------------------
<prerequisites>
  <maven>2.2.1</maven>
</prerequisites>
--------------------------------------

but based on the improvements in Maven within Maven 3 the
'prerequsites' part in the pom has been marked as depcrecated and will
not be checked. So to make sure a build will only works with a
particular Maven version for example 3.1.1 you need to go the
following path:

[source,xml,numbered]
--------------------------------------
<project ...>

  <!-- This marked as deprecated for Maven 3.X. This is checked by maven-enforcer-plugin -->
  <!--  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-4840 -->
  <!--  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-5297 -->

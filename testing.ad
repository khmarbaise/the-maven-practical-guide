= Testing with Maven

== Overview

Basic Unit Testing, Responsibilities of Plugins, Using JUnit, TestNG,
multi module builds and unit tests.

This chapter will give some practical hints how you can use unit- and
integration tests in relationship with Maven. Furthermore it will give
you tipps how to prevent several issues with testing.


Think about some examples about the following:

=== Unit Testing

Unit testing can be done out-of-box in Maven which means you just have
to locate your unit tests into 'src/test/java' and follow the naming
conventions. The resulting and recommended folder structure will be show
in the followin example.

[source,xml,numbered]
--------------------------------------
.
|-- pom.xml
`-- src
    |-- main
    |   `-- java
    |       `-- com
    |           `-- soebes
    |               `-- training
    |                   `-- maven
    |                       `-- simple
    |                           `-- BitMask.java
    `-- test
        `-- java
            `-- com
                `-- soebes
                    `-- training
                        `-- maven
                            `-- simple
                                `-- BitMaskTest.java
--------------------------------------

The folder 'src/main/java' plus an approriate package structure will
contain your production code whereas the 'src/test/java' plus the 
package structure will contains your unit test area.

.Naming Schema for Unit Tests
[width="60%",options="header"]
|==============================================
| Name Pattern    | Example
| Test*.java      | TestBitMask.java
| *Test.java      | BitMaskTest.java
| *TestCase.java  | BitMaskTestCase.java
|==============================================


The following simple example will show how a basic unit test can look
like.
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/ut-example/src/test/java/com/soebes/training/maven/simple/BitMaskTest.java[]
----

So if you follow the conventions in Maven and put your tests into the
appropriate locations 'src/test/java' those tests will automatically
be picked up and executed as unit tests. The plugin which is
responsible for execution of those unit tests is the
{link-maven-surefire-plugin}.

Make an example output here....

An important thing to think of is sometimes which test framework you
would like to use? There are things like {link-junit}, {link-testng},
Spock and of course many other opportunities.

In the case you would like to use {link-junit} within your unit tests
you just simply add the appropriate dependency to your 'pom.xml' and
that's it.

[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcedir}/ut-example/pom.xml[]
----

If you prefer {link-testng} to use for your unit tests you can simply
add the dependency for {link-testng} and your unit tests can be run as
well without any supplemental change except the changes based on the
differences between {link-junit} and {link-testng} itself.

[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcedir}/ut-example-testng/pom.xml[]
----


Location of unit tests

'src/test/java' is the correct location for unit tests.


Packaging of unit tests
execution of unit tests
Support of testing frameworks
JUnit, TestNG, Spock?, BDD ?


=== Integration Testing

What is integration tests?
How to use? Naming convention?
In which cases should be used a separate module?


Test an web application with Selenium? (Examples).

==== Importance of Separation

Why is it important to separate between unit tests and integration
tests?

If look into the formal definition of unit tests you will read things
like independent from any resource etc.  So you can by definition
parallelize unit tests in general. If you don't have real unit tests
you can't go that simple path to improve your build time.

In controdiction integration tests are not independent and could not
be parallized by default. Under special circumstances you might change
cause you know your code and of course your tests. This means to
parallelize integration tests is always a task which should be done
separately.
